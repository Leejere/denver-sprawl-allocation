## New Light Rail to Strasburg Will Likely Not Cause Significant Sprawl

---

We conducted a study to determine the sprawling implications of the proposed light rail from State Capitol to Strasburg. We studied the urban growth patterns of the Denver MSA (containing 10 counties) from 2010 to 2020, and used the results to project new urban development into 2030 in two scenarios: **business-as-usual** VS. **with the new light rail**. Here are the main findings of the study:

- The Denver MSA has done a good job containing urban sprawl from 2010 to 2030. New urban growth has been minimal despite a significant 16% population growth.

- Urban growth during the 2010-2020 period can be well-modeled based on existing land cover, population density, distances to key urban infrastructure, and proximity to existing urban areas.

- Using the model, we projected the urban growth during the 2020-2030 period, and found that the new light rail will likely not cause significant sprawl along it, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. It will, however, promote some urban growth around new stations in existing towns, e.g., Bennett and Strasburg, offering opportunities for transit-oriented development.
